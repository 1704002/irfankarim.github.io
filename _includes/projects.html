                                       Worked as the <b>Team Leader</b> in this final undergraduate project that encompasses and interconnects all the sectors of civil engineering and tests us if we're competent enough to be working as professional civil engineers.<br><br>With only cursory help from our respected teachers, we, as a team of 7 (seven) members, have completed the project of modernizing an existing market from scratch. Starting from problem identification and demand analysis with the data collected from the stakeholders through surveys and meetings, we have procured the inception report, analyzed the alternate solutions (reviewed by our teachers) and provided the feasibility report after conducting relevant assessments (SIA, EIA, TIA) and analyses (financial and economic feasiblity analysis). In addition to drafting relevant drawings (layout plans and components), we have also made a 3D model of the modernized market for better visualization. As this was a 4.5 credit project, we presented our final presentation to a panel of judges that included a combination of civil engineers and architects.

                                        As a junior project engineer, my contributions to this project are the same as stated in the "Top Supervision Project". Additionaly, I actively participated in traffic volume survey of this project, which, in addition to categorized vehicle counts, also included spot speed and average speed measurements for the vehicles. I also prepared the layout plan of the flyover and drafted some of the structural components using the software AutoCAD. Moreover, we (the JPEs) edited and compiled the Feasibility Report for this project.
