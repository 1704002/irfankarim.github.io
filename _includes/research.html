                            We will be analyzing several 4G LTE COTs devices to detect any noncompliant behavior that deviates from the
                            protocol specification. Active Automata Learning is being used to infer finite state machine from 4G LTE protocol
                            implementation. The deviation will be detected from the learned FSMs and the protocol specifications. This is a collaboration

                        Bangla Grammatical Error Detection Leveraging Transformer-based Token Classification

                            <strong>Abstractâ€”</strong> Bangla is the seventh most spoken language by a total number of speakers in the world, and yet the
                            development of an automated grammar checker in this language is an understudied problem. Bangla grammatical
                            error detection is a task of detecting sub-strings of a Bangla text that contain grammatical, punctuation, or spelling
                            errors, which is crucial for developing an automated Bangla typing assistant. Our approach involves breaking down
                            the task as a token classification problem and utilizing state-of-the-art transformer-based models. Finally, we combine
                            the output of these models and apply rule-based post-processing to generate a more reliable and comprehensive
                            result. Our system is evaluated on a dataset consisting of over 25,000 texts from various sources. Our best model
                            achieves a Levenshtein distance score of 1.04. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of different components of our
                            system.
