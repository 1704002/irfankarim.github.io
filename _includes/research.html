                        LogShield: A Transformer-based APT Detection System Leveraging Self-Attention

                            A framework designed to detect APT attack patterns leveraging the power of self-attention in
                            transformers. We incorporate customized embedding layers to effectively capture the context of event sequences
                            derived from provenance graphs. While acknowledging the computational overhead associated with training
                            transformer networks, our framework surpasses existing LSTM and Language models regarding APT detection
                            performance. We integrated the model parameters and training procedure from the RoBERTa model and conducted
                            extensive experiments on well-known APT datasets (DARPA OpTC and DARPA TC E3). Our framework achieved
                            superior F1 scores of 98\% and 95\% on the two datasets respectively, surpassing the F1 scores of 96\% and 94\%
                            obtained by LSTM models. Our findings suggest that LogShield's performance benefits from larger datasets and
                            demonstrates its potential for generalization across diverse domains.
